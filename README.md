This repository contains a collection of Synthetic CCDA Files that Particle Health (www.particlehealth.com) created.   

The repository is licensed using Creative Commons - Attribution (BY) license - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ 

The repository has 5 patients with different clinical conditions. The patients are named mnemonically to make them easier to remember: 

* [Freda Quently](Freda_Quently/README.md) - a patient with several recent urgent care visits
* [Artie Joinston](Artie_Jointson/README.md) - a patient with muskuloskeletal problems
* [Glynda Sugarman](Glynda_Sugarman/README.md) - a patient with diabetes
* [Hart Fallon](Hart_Fallon/README.md) - a patient with cardiac issues
* [Tuma Nephro](Tuma_Nephro/README.md) - an oncology patient (Myeloma) that also has Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)

Currently each patient has a single CCDA files with multiple encounters.  

For connection to the HIN networks, and sophisticated analytics off CCDA and FHIR data, please reach out to Particle Health. 

Future ideas: 
* Provide the same data in FHIR Format. 
* Provide the same data in a common schema format such as Tuva Project,  https://thetuvaproject.com/
* Split out the CCDA into several files.
