This repository contains a collection of Synthetic HL7 CCDA Files that Particle Health (www.particlehealth.com) has created and open sourced.

The repository has Consolidated CDAs (C-CDA) XML files of 5 patients with different clinical conditions, as well as AI-generated summaries of their medical history. The patients are named mnemonically to make them easier to remember: 

* [Freda Quently](Freda_Quently/README.md) - a patient with several recent urgent care visits
* [Artie Joinston](Artie_Jointson/README.md) - a patient with muskuloskeletal problems
* [Glynda Sugarman](Glynda_Sugarman/README.md) - a patient with diabetes
* [Hart Fallon](Hart_Fallon/README.md) - a patient with cardiac issues
* [Tuma Nephro](Tuma_Nephro/README.md) - an oncology patient (Myeloma) that also has Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)

Currently each patient is represented by a single CCDA file with multiple encounters.  

For connection to the HIN networks, and sophisticated analytics of CCDA and FHIR data, please reach out to Particle Health - https://www.particlehealth.com/. 

Future ideas: 
* Provide the same data in FHIR Format. 
* Split out the CCDA into several files.
