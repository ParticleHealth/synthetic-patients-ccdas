# Artie Joinston

The CCDA file shows data for a patient journey through chronic pain management over several years. Artie is an active individual for whom the onset of back pain and sciatica several years ago began to hinder his lifestyle and gradually worsened over time. Artie had always been health-conscious, but after developing degenerative disc disease, his condition became a constant barrier to the active life he once enjoyed. With each year, the pain has spread further, radiating down his left leg, a hallmark symptom of sciatica.

This showcases long term musculoskeletal data, including specialist, procedure and imaging notes. Highlights medications for chronic pain management.
