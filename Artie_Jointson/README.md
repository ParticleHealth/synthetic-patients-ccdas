Artie Joinston

This patient shows a patient journey through chronic pain management for years. Artie is an active individual for whom the onset of back pain and sciatica several years ago began to hinder his lifestyle and gradually worsened over time. Artie had always been health-conscious, but after developing degenerative disc disease, his condition became a constant barrier to the active life he once enjoyed. With each year, the pain has spread further, radiating down his left leg, a hallmark symptom of sciatica.
