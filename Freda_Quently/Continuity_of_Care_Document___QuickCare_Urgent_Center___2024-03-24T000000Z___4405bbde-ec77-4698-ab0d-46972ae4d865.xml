                                with a 2-week history of a persistent nonproductive cough.

                                produce any sputum. There is no associated fever, chills, chest pain, 
                                or shortness of contenteath. The patient denies any recent upper respiratory infections, 
                                exposure to sick contacts, or travel history. She reports occasional throat 
                                irritation but no significant pain. She has tried over-the-counter cough 
                                suppressants with minimal relief.

                                Follow up with primary care physician or return to urgent care in 2 weeks to reassess symptoms and review chest X-ray results.

                      <content>
                                Freda Quently is a 30-year-old female presenting with a persistent daily cough that 
                                has been ongoing for “awhile”. She says she’s tried a few different medications but 
                                doesn’t know what they were. The cough is severe enough to wake her from sleep. 
                                Additionally, she has experienced intermittent fevers and chills. Over the past week, 
                                she has noticed hoarseness in her voice and difficulty swallowing. The patient denies
                                any recent upper respiratory infections, exposure to sick contacts, or travel history. 
                                She reports no significant medical history and is not currently on any medications.

                                Persistent chronic cough with associated fever, chills, hoarseness, and difficulty swallowing. 
                                Differential diagnosis includes upper respiratory tract infection, laryngopharyngeal reflux, 
                                infectious laryngitis, or possible underlying pulmonary condition.

                                  Medications:
                                  Prescribe a short course of oral corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone) to reduce inflammation.
                                  Prescribe a proton pump inhibitor (e.g., omeprazole 20 mg daily) if reflux is suspected.
                                  Diagnostics:
                                  Order a chest X-ray to evaluate for any underlying pulmonary pathology.
                                  Recommend a throat swab and culture to rule out bacterial infection.
                                  Consider referral to an otolaryngologist (ENT) for further evaluation if symptoms persist or worsen.
                                  Follow-Up:
                                  Follow up in 1 week or sooner if symptoms worsen.
                                  Return to urgent care or see primary care physician for chest X-ray results and further management.
                                  Patient Education:
                                  Encourage hydration and use of throat lozenges to manage throat irritation.
                                  Advise on lifestyle modifications such as avoiding spicy foods and elevating the head of the bed if reflux is suspected.
                                  Discuss signs and symptoms that should prompt immediate return to urgent care, such as worsening fever, difficulty contenteathing, or severe throat pain.
